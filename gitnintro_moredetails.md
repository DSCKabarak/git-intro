### github

Helps you check on your different versions.

Keep track of changes made in a file

### Common Commands and meaning

    /*diff*/-->show the difference in two files

        diff file_name1.py file_name2.py

    /*diff -u**/--> shows more changes in details

        diff -u file_name1.py file_name2.py

        uses ++ for added lines and -- for removed files

    /*wdiff*/ --> words that have changed in a file

    /*meld,KDiff3,vimdiff*/ shows changes in a more graphic way


#### =======================================latetest commit

### Applying changes made to a file

### check the py files for the used scripts and variables in examples

    patch-->apply changes made to a file as either </>
    patch cpu_usage.py < cpu_usage.diff

### example: check for error fix in code for low space usage

    start by creating copies of each case
        cp disk_usage.py disk_usage_original.py
        cp disk_usage.py disk_usage_fixed.py
    after the fix,now commit the changes made to you college
        patch disk_usage.py  < disk_usage.diff

### Cheat Sheet

    diff
        diff is used to find differences between two files. On its own, itâ€™s a bit hard to use; instead, use it with diff -u to find lines which differ in two files:

    diff -u
        diff -u is used to compare two files, line by line, and have the differing lines compared side-by-side in the same output. See below:

            ~$ cat menu1.txt 
            Menu1:

            Apples
            Bananas
            Oranges
            Pears

            ~$ cat menu2.txt 
            Menu:

            Apples
            Bananas
            Grapes
            Strawberries

    Patch
        Patch is useful for applying file differences. See the below example, which compares two files. The comparison is saved as a .diff file, which is then patched to the    original file!
            ~$ cat hello_world.txt 
            Hello World
            ~$ cat hello_world_long.txt 
            Hello World
